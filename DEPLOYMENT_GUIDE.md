# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## âœ… **Workflow Fixed - Next Steps:**

### 1. **Enable GitHub Pages** (If not already done)
Go to your repository settings:
- Navigate to: `https://github.com/ZaZza402/PersonalWebS/settings/pages`
- Under **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions"
- Save the settings

### 2. **Verify Deployment Status**
- Check: `https://github.com/ZaZza402/PersonalWebS/actions`
- Look for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
- Should show âœ… green checkmark when successful

### 3. **Custom Domain Configuration**
In repository settings â†’ Pages:
- Add custom domain: `www.axiomweb.eu`
- Enable "Enforce HTTPS"

### 4. **DNS Configuration** (If not already set)
Point your domain to GitHub Pages:
```
Type: A Record
Host: @
Value: 
  185.199.108.153
  185.199.109.153
  185.199.110.153
  185.199.111.153

Type: CNAME  
Host: www
Value: zazza402.github.io
```

## ðŸ”§ **What I Fixed:**

1. **Added Required Permissions:**
   - `id-token: write` - Required for GitHub Pages deployment
   - `pages: write` - Permission to deploy to Pages
   - `contents: read` - Permission to read repository contents

2. **Proper Job Structure:**
   - **Build Job**: Builds the React app and uploads artifact
   - **Deploy Job**: Deploys the artifact to GitHub Pages (only on main branch)

3. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Added `github-pages` environment
   - Added concurrency control to prevent deployment conflicts

## ðŸš€ **Expected Result:**
Your website should now deploy successfully to `https://www.axiomweb.eu` with:
- All React routes working (no 404 errors)
- Modern UI with 8 code snippets
- Blog and portfolio sections
- Mobile responsive design
- SEO optimization
